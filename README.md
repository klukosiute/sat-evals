# SAT Evals

Corresponding scripts to my rant on [how maybe we shouldn't give LLMs standardized tests](https://publish.obsidian.md/kamilelukosiute/llms/Maybe+just+don't+give+language+models+standardized+tests). 

`sat_evals.py` contains the script for the two evals (text and vision), the three `.cache` files contain sampling results. 

`asy-eval.txt` is an unscientific evaluation of how well LLMs understand the Asymptote Graphics Language, which I did by copy and pasting the prompts in that file to my GPT-4 cli tool :)
