D. 4.24","To find the increase in annual worldwide production of avocados from 2010 to 2011, we need to calculate f(2011) - f(2010).

Let's first calculate f(2010):
f(2010) = 0.17(2010-2000) + 2.54
f(2010) = 0.17(10) + 2.54
f(2010) = 1.7 + 2.54
f(2010) = 4.24

Now, let's calculate f(2011):

f(2011) = 0.17(11) + 2.54
f(2011) = 1.87 + 2.54
f(2011) = 4.41

Now, we can find the increase:
f(2011) - f(2010) = 4.41 - 4.24
f(2011) - f(2010) = 0.17

Let the height of trapezoid ABCD be h, and let the height of trapezoid PQRS be 3h (since the sides are 3 times the length of trapezoid ABCD).

C.  $y=4x-1$
D.  $y=4x+1$","We can see that the graph is a straight line passing through the points (-2,-9) and (4,15). 

To find the equation of a line passing through two points $ (x_1, y_1) $ and $ (x_2, y_2) $, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation:

$ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) $

where $ m $ is the slope of the line, given by:

$ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} $

In this case, $ (x_1, y_1) = (-2, -9) $ and $ (x_2, y_2) = (4, 15) $.

The slope is:

$ m = \frac{15 - (-9)}{4 - (-2)} = \frac{24}{6} = 4 $

Using the point-slope form with $ (x_1, y_1) = (-2, -9) $ and $ m = 4 $, we get:

$ y - (-9) = 4(x - (-2)) $

$ y + 9 = 4(x + 2) $

$ y + 9 = 4x + 8 $

$ y = 4x - 1 $
